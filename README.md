- 👋 Hi, I’m @productinventor
- 👀 I’m interested in hardware and AI and any invention where the physical world interacts with the digital.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning fpgas, getting deeper into Python and brushing up on Linux.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that do some good: helping people, communities etc in the face of transition.
